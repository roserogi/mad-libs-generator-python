# üìù Mad Libs Generator (Python)

This is a simple and fun Mad Libs-style game written in Python. It reads a story from a text file and replaces placeholders like `<noun>` or `<verb>` with words provided by the user.

## üìú How It Works

1. A text file named `story.txt` contains a story with placeholders inside `< >`.
2. The Python script:
   - Reads the story from the file
   - Finds all unique placeholders like `<noun>`, `<verb>`, etc.
   - Prompts the user to enter a word for each placeholder
   - Replaces all placeholders in the story
3. The final story is printed with all user input filled in!
